         <h3 class= "title-test"> Here's a timeline of Dr. Borlaug's             life:</h3><br>
      <ul>
        <li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
        <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University             of Minnesota, thanks to a Depression era program known               as the "National Youth Administration"
        </li>
        <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works             in the Civilian Conservation Corps, helping starving                 Americans. "I saw how food changed them", he said. "All             of this left scars on me."
        </li>
        <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US                 Forestry Service
        </li>
        <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets                 laid off due to budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles               Stakman, he returns to school study under Stakman, who               teaches him about breeding pest-resistent plants.
        </li>
        <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl               Harbor attack, but is rejected. Instead, the military               asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, DDT to control             malaria, disinfectants, and other applied science.
        </li>
        <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology
        </li>
        <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,                   leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to             head a new plant pathology program. Over the next 16                 years, his team breeds 6,000 different strains of                   disease resistent wheat - including different varieties             for each major climate on Earth.
        </li>
        <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each season,             doubling wheat yields
        </li>
        <li>1953 - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat with             a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that               responds well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95%               of Mexico's wheat.
        </li>
        <li>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings his high-yielding strains             of wheat to the Indian subcontinent in time to help                 mitigate mass starvation due to a rapidly expanding                 population
        </li>
        <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
        <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically                   increase their maize and sorghum yields
        </li>
        <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M                        University
        </li>
        <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food                       supply by 2050." Argues that genetically modified crops                     are the only way we can meet the demand, as we run out of                  arable land. Says that GM crops are not inherently dangerous                because "we've been genetically modifying plants and animals               for a long time. Long before we  called it science, people were             selecting the best breeds."
        </li>
        <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95.</li>
      </ul>
      <p> <cite class="citation">"Borlaug's life and achievement are                     testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's                   towering intellect, persistence and scientific vision can                        make to  human peace and progress."
